What is BMI?
Body mass index, or BMI, is used to determine whether you are in a healthy weight range for your height.

It is useful to consider BMI alongside waist circumference, as waist measurement helps to assess risk by measuring the amount of fat carried around your middle.

BMI is a useful measurement for most people over 18 years old. But it is only an estimate and it doesn’t take into account age, ethnicity, gender and body composition. We recommend you also check your waist measurement and other risk factors.

Speak to your doctor, an Accredited Practising Dietitian or a health practitioner about your weight.

This calculator shouldn’t be used for pregnant women or children.
